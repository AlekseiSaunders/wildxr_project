Consider adding a fixtures folder to root.
    In this folder, add files that supply test data across the test suite to all pages
    Files could be users_fixtures data_fixtures, etc.
    Centralizes test data for manipulation (think testing -1, 0 , +1 scenarios)
    Import these fixtures into the conftest.py file to make them available cross testsuite
    Need to balance this with simplicity
    Use Faker in fixture file to supply randomly generated data.

Consider using parameterized fixture to supply data.
    Could be used to test the various levels of autherization within the suite
    Can pass multiple parameterized fixtures to a test to test all permitations
    Can use a parameterized fixture to supply various expected failure entries as well
        invalid creds 
        too short creds
        too long creds
        missing creds
    Consider this for multiple data entry points (Video Titles, Catalogue titles, etc)
